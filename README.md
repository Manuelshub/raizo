# Raizo

Raizo is an autonomous AI-agent powered protocol sentinel for multi-chain risk management in decentralized finance (DeFi). In an ecosystem where total value locked (TVL) has climbed to around $120 billion as of early 2026, yet hacks inflicted over $3.4 billion in cryptocurrency losses during 2025, Raizo addresses critical gaps in proactive security and regulatory compliance through verifiable, decentralized orchestration.

### Core Problem Solved
DeFi protocols remain vulnerable to exploits like flash loans, liquidity drains, and access-control flaws, which accounted for a significant portion of 2025's damages despite improved on-chain code security. Traditional monitoring tools are reactive and siloed, failing to predict threats or automate responses across chains. Raizo shifts to autonomous, AI-driven prevention, integrating on-chain data with external sources to forecast risks and enforce safeguards, while ensuring compliance in regulated environments.

### Key Features
- **Autonomous AI Agents**: Powered by Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) workflows, agents consume on-chain metrics (e.g., TVL, transaction anomalies) and external APIs (e.g., cybersecurity threat feeds) to run LLM-based predictions on vulnerabilities like exploit patterns. Agents self-fund operations via x402 payments for gasless, sustained execution.
- **Predictive Safeguards**: Real-time analysis triggers automated actions, such as pausing contracts or issuing alerts, with verifiable outputs via Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) to minimize false positives and hallucinations.
- **Compliance and Reporting**: An integrated Automated Compliance Engine (ACE) generates dynamic reports for regulatory standards (e.g., AML/KYC, ESG audits), adapting to evolving rules like EU's MiCA or SEC tokenized asset guidelines.
- **Privacy-Preserving Design**: Utilizes Chainlink Confidential Compute and HTTP for secure API interactions, shielding sensitive keys and private assessments from on-chain exposure.
- **Multi-Chain Orchestration**: Leverages Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) for seamless risk monitoring and triggers across ecosystems like Ethereum and Base, enabling unified protection in fragmented environments.
- **Sybil-Resistant Monitoring**: Incorporates World ID for proof-of-humanness in DAO governance checks, preventing manipulation in community-driven protocols.

### How It Works
Raizo's CRE-based orchestration layer simulates or deploys workflows that bridge blockchains with off-chain data, LLMs, and AI agents. For instance, an agent might detect unusual transaction spikes via Ethereum data, cross-reference with threat APIs, predict a potential drain, and execute a cross-chain pause on Base—all while maintaining privacy and generating auditable compliance logs. Deployable via CRE CLI for testing, it supports live networks for production.

### Unique Value and Impact
Unlike static tools like Forta or Hypernative, Raizo's agentic AI enables true autonomy, reducing human error—the primary driver of 2025's losses—while delivering verifiable, multi-chain compliance. This fosters institutional trust, potentially unlocking further TVL growth in a maturing $120B+ market, by transforming risk management from reactive defense to predictive resilience.
